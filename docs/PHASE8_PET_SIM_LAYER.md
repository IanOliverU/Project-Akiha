# Phase 8: Pet Sim Layer

**Status:** Planned

## Phase Goal

Add a persistent care loop that lets Akiha's condition change over time and
respond to deliberate user care without coupling pet mechanics to conversation
language or AI-provider output.

## Hard Architecture Rule

Pet state is structured, language-neutral application data.

- Hunger, attention, affection, energy, XP, level, and currency are stored as
  typed values.
- Time decay and care actions modify those values through explicit domain
  rules.
- Mood, proactive behavior, animation, and dialogue may reflect pet state.
- Dialogue, sentiment, translations, and language-specific keywords must never
  be used as the source of truth for pet-state changes.
- AI output must not directly write pet statistics.

```text
Clock / explicit care action / approved interaction event
    -> Pet domain rules
        -> Validated state transition
            -> SQLite repository and history
                -> Pet-state event
                    -> UI / mood / proactive behavior / voice reaction
```

This preserves the same mechanics whether Akiha is speaking Japanese, English,
or another language in the future.

## Planned Scope

- Persistent hunger, attention or affection, and energy statistics.
- Bounded time decay, including elapsed time while the app was closed.
- Explicit care actions such as feeding, resting, and spending time together.
- XP, levels, and currency accrual from validated interactions.
- Pet status and care controls.
- Attention-seeking behavior through the existing notification policy.
- Voice and animation reactions derived from structured pet-state events.
- Settings, diagnostics, reset behavior, automated tests, and packaged smoke.

## Out Of Scope

- Parsing conversation text to infer pet statistics.
- Allowing an AI provider to mutate pet state directly.
- Punitive death or irreversible neglect.
- Shop spending, inventory, wearable cosmetics, or Live2D work.
- Permission-gated assistant actions.

## Preliminary Checklist

- [ ] Define typed pet-state models and invariants.
- [ ] Define decay, offline elapsed-time, and clock rules.
- [ ] Add SQLite pet-state and history migrations.
- [ ] Implement repository and pet-state service boundaries.
- [ ] Add explicit care actions.
- [ ] Add XP, levels, and currency accrual.
- [ ] Add pet status and care UI.
- [ ] Integrate structured pet events with mood and proactive behavior.
- [ ] Add voice and animation reactions.
- [ ] Add settings, diagnostics, and reset behavior.
- [ ] Add automated and manual verification.
